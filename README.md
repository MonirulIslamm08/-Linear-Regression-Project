 Where I delved into  regression analysis to uncover insights from customer data. ðŸ“Š Using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and seaborn, I explored relationships between variables and developed a predictive model to understand factors influencing yearly customer spending.


## What Is Regression?
Regression is a statistical method used in finance, investing, and other disciplines that attempts to determine the strength and character of the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

Linear regression is the most common form of this technique. Also called simple regression or ordinary least squares (OLS), linear regression establishes the linear relationship between two variables.

Linear regression is graphically depicted using a straight line of best fit with the slope defining how the change in one variable impacts a change in the other. The y-intercept of a linear regression relationship represents the value of the dependent variable when the value of the independent variable is zero. Nonlinear regression models also exist, but are far more complex.

Key Takeaways
Regression is a statistical technique that relates a dependent variable to one or more independent variables.
A regression model is able to show whether changes observed in the dependent variable are associated with changes in one or more of the independent variables.
It does this by essentially determining a best-fit line and seeing how the data is dispersed around this line.
Regression helps economists and financial analysts in things ranging from asset valuation to making predictions.
For regression results to be properly interpreted, several assumptions about the data and the model itself must hold.
In economics, regression is used to help investment managers value assets and understand the relationships between factors such as commodity prices and the stocks of businesses dealing in those commodities.

While a powerful tool for uncovering the associations between variables observed in data, it cannot easily indicate causation. Regression as a statistical technique should not be confused with the concept of regression to the mean, also known as mean reversion.


## Understanding Regression
Regression captures the correlation between variables observed in a data set and quantifies whether those correlations are statistically significant or not.


The two basic types of regression are simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, although there are nonlinear regression methods for more complicated data and analysis. Simple linear regression uses one independent variable to explain or predict the outcome of the dependent variable Y, while multiple linear regression uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome. Analysts can use stepwise regression to examine each independent variable contained in the linear regression model.

Regression can help finance and investment professionals. For instance, a company might use it to predict sales based on weather, previous sales, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, or other types of conditions. The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is an often-used regression model in finance for pricing assets and discovering the costs of capital.

Regression and Econometrics
Econometrics is a set of statistical techniques used to analyze data in finance and economics. An example of the application of econometrics is to study the income effect using observable data. An economist may, for example, hypothesize that as a person increases their income, their spending will also increase.

If the data show that such an association is present, a regression analysis can then be conducted to understand the strength of the relationship between income and consumption and whether or not that relationship is statistically significant.

Note that you can have several independent variables in an analysisâ€”for example, changes to GDP and inflation in addition to unemployment in explaining stock market prices. When more than one independent variable is used, it is referred to as multiple linear regression. This is the most commonly used tool in econometrics.

Econometrics is sometimes criticized for relying too heavily on the interpretation of regression output without linking it to economic theory or looking for causal mechanisms. It is crucial that the findings revealed in the data are able to be adequately explained by a theory.
