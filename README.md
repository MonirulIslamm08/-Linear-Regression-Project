# -Linear-Regression-Project
 where I delved into linear regression analysis to uncover insights from customer data. üìä Using Python libraries like pandas, NumPy, and seaborn, I explored relationships between variables and developed a predictive model to understand factors influencing yearly customer spending.



##Key Highlights:
‚úÖ Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis revealed trends and correlations.
‚úÖ Built a predictive model using sklearn that achieved a high R¬≤ score of 0.989, showing excellent accuracy.
‚úÖ Identified "Length of Membership" as the most significant feature for predicting yearly spending.

üîç Takeaways:

Strengthened my data analysis and modeling skills.
Gained hands-on experience in interpreting model coefficients and making actionable recommendations.



**Interpreting the coefficients:

** Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Avg. Session Length is associated with an increase of 25.98 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on App is associated with an increase of 38.59 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Time on Website is associated with an increase of 0.19 total dollars spent. Holding all other features fixed, a 1 unit increase in Length of Membership is associated with an increase of 61.27 total dollars spent.

Do you think the company should focus more on their mobile app or on their website?

** This is tricky, there are two ways to think about this: Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, you would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion!
